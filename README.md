# RCNN-Object-Recognition

This project implementation is based on the IEEE COnference Paper Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network for Object Recognition.
The aim of the paper and the implementation is to bring in context to the lower layers of a convolutional neural network through recurrent connections that can help improve accuracy of object recognition. This approach helps increasing performance when using cropped images or occluded images.

Datasets: The uploaded implementation uses CIFAR 10. Can be applied for CIFAR100,SVHN and MNIST.
Library: PyTorch
